TO UPLOAD THE NEW FOLDER INTO THE GITHUB THAT CONTAINS MANY FOLDER WITHIN.
***************************************************************************
STEPS ARE:-
(try to do in master only not main because git bash default inits in master branch)
open the folder in git bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"   /** inside the double quote you could write anything it is just to let the computer know that we are verifying it **/
git branch -M main (OR) git branch -M master   /** look whether the branch is main or master (you can see the master or main at git bash **/
git remote add origin <github link>   /** the link will be pasted inside <> without that <> sign (one cam get the link above the repository name) **/
git push -u origin main (OR) git push -u origin master



AFTER this
open github select the respective repository
go to settings
change the default branch to master
click on master branch after you see it
then go to view all branches one step back
delete other (non necessary branches)
DONE...



TO COMMIT CHANGES INTO THE REPOSITORY ALREADY PUSHED.
******************************************************
git status (just to know what to do)
git add .
git commit -m "any message"
git push origin main (OR) git push origin master (check in repository in github)

IF this doesn't work and says to pull first then do this
git pull origin main --rebase (OR) git pull origin master --rebase
git push origin main (OR) git push origin master
